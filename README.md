## üéØ Project Overview

GraphGuard is an AI agent-based network traffic and threat simulation platform that detects and mitigates network attacks in real time. It employs six autonomous AI agents, integrates the CIC DDoS 2019 dataset (431k+ labeled flows), and supports NetFlow v5 for following industry standards. The system combines real-world traffic modeling with interactive 3D threat visualization.
